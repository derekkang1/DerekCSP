## About Me
Hi, I'm Derek Kang. I'm currently 14 years old and a freshmen at DNHS, Class of 2027. My academic interests are math and science, particularly physics and chemistry. In my free time I like to play Brawl Stars and hang out with my friends. My hobbies include playing violin, playing tennis, biking, snowboarding, and robotics. I can speak chinese, as well as english. My favorite food is pasta.
