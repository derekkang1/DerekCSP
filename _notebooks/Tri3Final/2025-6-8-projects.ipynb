    "# Open Coding Society – Github Analytics & Grade Predictor\n",
    "\n",
    "We expanded the existing OCS dashboard into a richer, more interactive analytics hub backed by secure, JWT-protected APIs and a lightweight “smart” grade model.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Purpose\n",
    "- Existing GitHub analytics were sometimes inaccurate, hard to navigate, and couldn’t drill down into specific contributions.  \n",
    "- Grade estimates were fixed, ignoring the breadth of a student’s work.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What’s New\n",
    "\n",
    "### Interactive Dashboard\n",
    "- Tabbed sections for:\n",
    "  - **GitHub Analytics**\n",
    "  - **Smart Grade Predictor**\n",
    "  - **Admin Search Pane**\n",
    "  - **Help**\n",
    "- Clickable **commit cards** linking directly to the GitHub commit\n",
    "- **Admin tools** to look up users by UID\n",
    "- Grade Predictor tool based on commits or holeistic view\n",
    "\n",
    "### API Enhancements (`/api/analytics`)\n",
    "- All endpoints are **JWT-secured**\n",
    "- Powered by the `GitHubUser` class using the **GitHub GraphQL API**\n",
    "- Supports optional **date ranges**, defaulting to trimester 3\n",
    "- User Endpoints:\n",
    "  - `GET /github/user`\n",
    "  - `GET /github/user/commits`\n",
    "  - `GET /github/user/prs`\n",
    "  - `GET /github/user/issues`\n",
    "  - `GET /github/user/issue_comments`\n",
    "  - `GET /github/user/received_issue_comments`\n",
    "- Admin Endpoints:\n",
    "  - `GET /commits/<uid>`\n",
    "  - `GET /issues/<uid>`\n",
    "\n",
    "## Smart Grade Predictor\n",
    "- Two modes:\n",
    "  - **Basic** – Based on commit count\n",
    "  - **Smart** – Weighted GitHub activity metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "## Outcome\n",
    "Students and instructors now get clearer, drill-down insight into coding activity and a dynamic grade estimate grounded in holistic GitHub metrics — all while maintaining secure access controls.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# My Contributions:\n",
    "As backend engineer, I tested all existing endpoints for the analytics api in postman and through frontend, switched admin endpoints to get ratehr than post for consistency.\n",
    "<img src=\"{{site.baseurl}}/images/final1.png\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "Added line changes per commit, and total line changes into get_commit_stats function in model file\n",
    "<img src=\"{{site.baseurl}}/images/final2.png\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "Added admin feature on frontend that calls admin-user commits endpoint, allows admin to look at anyone in the database's commits in carded format:\n",
    "\n",
    "Contributed to integration onto dashboard of OCS, merging with other grade anayltics groups.\n",

    "# InterTravel\n",
    "### Group’s purpose\n",
    "We wanted to create a travel planner with a varities of functions for the user: “To make a budget-friendly travel planner that will allow users to find activities, hotels, restaurants, and much more.”\n",
    "\n",
    "This project was depolyed and had working log in systems, as well as a backend site.\n",
    "\n",
    "It would include info for 5 different cities (planned):\n",
    "- Paris (only one integrated)\n",
    "- Hong Kong\n",
    "- New York\n",
    "- Mumbai\n",
    "- London\n",
    "\n",
    "It would include these functionalities:\n",
    "- Activity Planner: users can search for activities in the city they are visiting and ask questions to a chatbot for help.\n",
    "- Lodging Listings: users can search for hotels in their city and give them a star rating.\n",
    "- Packing Portal: users can select which items to carry with them while travelling.\n",
    "- Cuisine Chronicles: users can view the menu of restaurants and give reviews.\n",
    "- Fair Fares: users can search for flights to and from their destination and compare prices.\n",
    "- Budget Brilliance: users can set their budget for the trip and see suggestions.\n",
    "- Wellness waypoints: users can search for hospitals in their area in the case of an emergency.\n",
    "\n",
    "### My contributions\n",
    "I built a section of the website that helps the user plan their travel budget with functional and user-friendly frontend and dynamically updating APIs that connect to the backend. It will include these planned features.\n",
    "- Budget Plan Assister:\n",
    "  - takes in user inputed location, budget and any hard set attractions or travel items with predetermined price, user can then also input what they need help with finding (ex. hotels)\n",
    "  - Outputs budget entries into a nice table with clear depictions, and also the remaining budget\n",
    "  - integrates smoothly into the overall daily planning system. The user should be able to add budgeting concerns and details to their daily itinerary and travel plan\n",
    "  - currency converter API\n",
