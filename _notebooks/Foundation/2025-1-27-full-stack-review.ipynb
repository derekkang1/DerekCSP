    "## Collaboration\n",
    "### Group’s purpose\n",
    "We wanted to create a travel planner with a varities of functions for the user: “To make a budget-friendly travel planner that will allow users to find activities, hotels, restaurants, and much more.”\n",
    "\n",
    "It would include info for 5 different cities:\n",
    "- Paris\n",
    "- Hong Kong\n",
    "- New York\n",
    "- Mumbai\n",
    "- London\n",
    "\n",
    "It would include these functionalities:\n",
    "- Activity Planner: users can search for activities in the city they are visiting and ask questions to a chatbot for help.\n",
    "- Lodging Listings: users can search for hotels in their city and give them a star rating.\n",
    "- Packing Portal: users can select which items to carry with them while travelling.\n",
    "- Cuisine Chronicles: users can view the menu of restaurants and give reviews.\n",
    "- Fair Fares: users can search for flights to and from their destination and compare prices.\n",
    "- Budget Brilliance: users can set their budget for the trip and see suggestions.\n",
    "- Wellness waypoints: users can search for hospitals in their area in the case of an emergency.\n",
    "\n",
    "### My purpose\n",
    "I need to build a section of the website that helps the user plan their travel budget with functional and user-friendly frontend and dynamically updating APIs that connect to the backend. It will include these planned features.\n",
    "- Budget Plan Assister:\n",
    "  - Will take in user inputed location, budget and any hard set attractions or travel items with predetermined price, user can then also input what they need help with finding (ex. hotels)\n",
    "  - Outputs approximated remaining budget and will suggest things to do with remaining budget\n",
    "  - integrates smoothly into the overall daily planning system. The user should be able to add budgeting concerns and details to their daily itinerary and travel plan\n",
    "-  Pricing Reviews Posts:\n",
    "    - Post API system that allows user to look at and make posts about a certain activity or place on a trip with a review on how much value said item was (1 to 5 stars)\n",
    "- Budget Guide:\n",
    "  - Guide on how to budget in case users want to budget on their own\n",
    "- Budgeting form template:\n",
    "  - Have a template and interface system which will allow user to format their budgeting plan neatly and share with others when they are done\n"
