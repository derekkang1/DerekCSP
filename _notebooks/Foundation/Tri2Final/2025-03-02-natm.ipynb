    "I wasn't able to make N@TM at school, but thanks to Mr. Buxton, we wer able to redo it at the DECA State Conference, where I was able to share our project with other student all across California, not just from our school. Many of the students from other schools were also taking CSP or CSA, and it was cool to share my experiences with COmpSci with thema nd learn about they they were different and similar to the otehr school's comp sci programs.\n",

    "Night at the Museum was a great oppurtunity for us because we were able to get feedback from other parents and students, simulating real user feedback. They gave us feedback and tips to improve both our presentation skills, our features, and also asked us some insightful questions.\n",

In addition I offered my computer where they could interact with and try out the features for themselves and the google form our group used to leave comments and give us feedback.\n",
