    "## What I will improve on in the future\n",
    "1. **Make a clear plan for ever project** For every project in this class and for even more after I graduate, I'll make sure to use issues, flowcharts, and design tools to plan out my project steps and make sure I know exactly what and how I can accomplish my goals. Tools like draw.io ir figma will help me organize my ideas visually. For example, before starting a big coding project, I’ll map out how the program will work step by step. I can also use this method to plan my goals, like choosing a college or preparing for an internship in hte future\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Focus on improvin gmy public spekaing and presenation skills** By enhancing my public speaking and presentation skills to confidently communicate ideas in professional settings, I will be able to effectively influence and engage audiences, build credibility, and create stronger connections with colleagues, or whoever I am talking to. This will allow me to present complex ideas with clarity, potentially achiving internships or other jobs in the future.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Work on improving my time management** Strategies by utilizing productivity tools and techniques more efficiently will help me stop procrastinnating and improve my work ethic efficiency. I will be able to prioritize tasks with greater precision, minimize distractions, which will allow me to accomplish more in less time, reduce procrastination, and maintain a consistent pace toward achieving both short-term and long-term goals\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Be more creative** In Mr Mort's class, I can use it as a creative outlet and work on my passions. I’ll focus on projects and clubs that align with what I love, like robotics or coding challenges. This will help me stay motivated and learn skills that I actually enjoy using. In CSP, I want to work on creative coding projects, like building interactive games or apps.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Practice Self-Reflection and improve on mistakes** By practicing self-reflection, I will develop a deeper awareness of my strengths, weaknesses, and areas of growth. I shouldn't be afraid of making mistakes, and when I do make them, i will take them as an oppurtunity to learn form them and growth myself. By reflecting on myself regularly throughout my learning journies, I can recognize patterns in my productivity, and I can make intentional adjustments to my learning strategies and set more realistic goals."
