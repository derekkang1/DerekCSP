    "# Open Coding Society – Github Analytics & Grade Predictor\n",
    "\n",
    "We expanded the existing OCS dashboard into a richer, more interactive analytics hub backed by secure, JWT-protected APIs and a lightweight “smart” grade model.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Purpose\n",
    "- Existing GitHub analytics were sometimes inaccurate, hard to navigate, and couldn’t drill down into specific contributions.  \n",
    "- Grade estimates were fixed, ignoring the breadth of a student’s work.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What’s New\n",
    "\n",
    "### Interactive Dashboard\n",
    "- Tabbed sections for:\n",
    "  - **GitHub Analytics**\n",
    "  - **Smart Grade Predictor**\n",
    "  - **Admin Search Pane**\n",
    "  - **Help**\n",
    "- Clickable **commit cards** linking directly to the GitHub commit\n",
    "- **Admin tools** to look up users by UID\n",
    "- Grade Predictor tool based on commits or holeistic view\n",
    "\n",
    "### API Enhancements (`/api/analytics`)\n",
    "- All endpoints are **JWT-secured**\n",
    "- Powered by the `GitHubUser` class using the **GitHub GraphQL API**\n",
    "- Supports optional **date ranges**, defaulting to trimester 3\n",
    "- User Endpoints:\n",
    "  - `GET /github/user`\n",
    "  - `GET /github/user/commits`\n",
    "  - `GET /github/user/prs`\n",
    "  - `GET /github/user/issues`\n",
    "  - `GET /github/user/issue_comments`\n",
    "  - `GET /github/user/received_issue_comments`\n",
    "- Admin Endpoints:\n",
    "  - `GET /commits/<uid>`\n",
    "  - `GET /issues/<uid>`\n",
    "\n",
    "## Smart Grade Predictor\n",
    "- Two modes:\n",
    "  - **Basic** – Based on commit count\n",
    "  - **Smart** – Weighted GitHub activity metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "## Outcome\n",
    "Students and instructors now get clearer, drill-down insight into coding activity and a dynamic grade estimate grounded in holistic GitHub metrics — all while maintaining secure access controls.\n"
