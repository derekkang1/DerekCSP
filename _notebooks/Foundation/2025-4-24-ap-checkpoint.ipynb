    "## How I’ve Been Studying\n",
    "- To prepare effectively, I’ve developed a consistent study routine that focuses on both practice and review. One of my main strategies has been actively engaging with the multiple-choice questions (MCQs) provided by College Board. These questions help me get familiar with the style and rigor of the questions that may appear on assessments, and they also highlight areas where I need to improve.\n",
    "\n",
    "- After each lesson, I make it a point to go back and thoroughly review the content we’ve covered in class. I also complete the lesson \"hacks\" that we’ve been assigned throughout the trimester. These hacks have been especially useful for reinforcing the key concepts and making sure I understand the different ways the material can be applied. They often provide a deeper look into the topic and help me retain the information more effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Once I feel comfortable with a topic, I return to the College Board MCQs I’ve already done and focus specifically on the ones related to that lesson. This targeted practice allows me to test my understanding in a more focused way and see how well I can apply what I’ve learned. It’s also helpful for identifying patterns in the types of questions I tend to miss, so I can revisit those concepts and strengthen my skills further.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, this approach—combining review, structured practice, and reflection—has significantly improved my understanding of the material. It’s helped me become more confident in tackling different types of questions, and it’s reflected in the strong scores I’ve been getting on my multiple-choice assessments.\n",
