    "1. What is a hex color code? What are some examples?\n",
    "A hex color code is a six-digit code used in HTML, CSS, and other design tools to represent colors. It uses hexadecimal (base-16) values to define the intensity of red, green, and blue in a color.\n",

    "2. What is Base64 and how is it used with images?\n",
    "Base64 is a method for encoding binary data (like an image) into a text format using only ASCII characters. It’s commonly used to embed image data directly inside web pages or scripts.\n",
    "\n",
    "When an image is Base64-encoded, it becomes a long string that can be used in an img tag or a data URI.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Why might you use Base64 instead of a regular image file?\n",
    "\n",
    "You might use Base64 instead of linking to an image file when:\n",
    "- You want to embed the image directly in the document without requiring an external file.\n",
    "- You’re working in environments with no file system access, like online notebooks (e.g., Google Colab).\n",
    "- You want to send images as text, for example, in JSON or XML payloads over a network.\n",
    "\n",
    "When sharing notebooks with others, Base64 ensures the image stays embedded and doesn’t break due to missing file links.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Insert an image into your Jupyter notebook and explain how it’s stored and displayed."
